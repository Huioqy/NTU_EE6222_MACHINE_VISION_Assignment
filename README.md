#### Assignment One

Using Random Vector Functional Link Networks (RVFLN) as the base model, investigate the following issues:

1. Effect of direct links from the input layer to the output layer (i.e. with and without)

2. Effect of the bias in the output neuron (i.e. with and without)

3. Effect of scaling the random features before feeding them into the activation function.

4. Performances of 2 activation functions: one from “sigmoid, radbas, sine, sign” and one from “hardlim, tribas”

5. Performance of Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse and ridge regression (or regularized least square solutions)
for the computation of the output weights.

#### Assignment Two

Take snaps with the same camera of an outdoor scene, and find the fundamental matrix for these two images
